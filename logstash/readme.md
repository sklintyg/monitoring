To run setup.sh specify which files (or "all" for all three) that should be modified with the path to the
directory containing the custom patterns needed to run these filters.

Examples
=======

```
./setup.sh all ./patterns
```
or
```
./setup.sh logstash-webcert-log.conf /opt/inera/misc/patterns
```
or wherever the patterns directory is located.
